## Personal Background

My name is Ritvik Raj, a second year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur, India. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science.

I use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my workstation and Sublime text as primary text editor. I've been coding in C, C++ & python for over 2 years now and in java for under a year and am proficient in all four of them. 

Since I started programming as a web developer, I used Django all the time which made me familiar with Python in the beginning. 

I'm very much interested in web development and work as a Sub Head , Web team of our college and thus have a good idea of basic elements of web designing, namely:

HTML5, CSS, CSS3, JSON, REST, MySQL, PHP, Django, JS, jQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap & Materialize frameworks. 

I know how to use Git and Github. If I am stuck, I go to Google and always come back with a solution.
